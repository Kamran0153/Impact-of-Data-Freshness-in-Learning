# How Does Data Freshness Affect Real-time Supervised Learning?

This work analyzes the impact of data freshness on real-time supervised learning, where a neural network is trained to predict a time-varying target based on an observed feature. It is generally believed that the prediction error grows as the feature becomes stale. Our study shows that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can be closely approximated as a Markov chain; and not true if the data sequence is far from a Markov model, e.g., due to long-range dependence and communication delay. We consider the design of a feature communication system, in which a transmitter (e.g., a sensor or camera) sends features to a receiver that contains a neural network. By using the Gittins index theory, we develop an optimal feature buffering and transmission strategy that minimizes the prediction error and has low complexity. This result holds (i) for both Markovian and non-Markovian data, (ii) for general transmission time distributions from the transmitter to the receiver, and (iii) for a broad class of supervised learning algorithms. Numerical and experimental results are provided to illustrate our findings.
